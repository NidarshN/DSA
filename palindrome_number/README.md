# Palindrome Number

> **Topics:** Math

[Leetcode #9](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

## Examples

``` text
Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

``` text
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

``` text
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

## Constraints

``` text
-231 <= x <= 231 - 1
```

Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
